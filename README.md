# Task-2-Car-Leasing-Calculator
This is my solution for Task 2 of the Prime Holding Internship Assignment. The README file briefly explains how I managed to solve the problem.

I used 2 files for the solution:
- index.html: It contains both the HTML and Javascript logics.
- style.cs: It contains the CSS logic.

In the head of index.html I used a <script> tag to enter a Javascript method for calculating the interest rate, down payment, monthly installment and total leasing cost.
In the body, I used the <div> tag the divide the page into 2 columns - left and right. On the left side, we have a text input box with the car type and a range slider with the car value, and on the right side -  a text input box with the the lease period and a range slider with the down payment's percentage. 

The result is seperated from the input by a horizontal breakup line. On the left side of the result are the total leasing cost and down payment, and on the right side - the monthly payment and interest rate. Both sides of the result are seperated by a vertical breakup line.

In the css file, I changed the font to Ariel, resized the input fields and made 2 queries, which are meant to give the website a responsive design and make it appropriately resizeable across mobile and desktop devices.
